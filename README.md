# Kampai Cocktails

(This was created during our time as students at Code Chrysalis.)

On a cold, lonely night, you want to curl up on the sofa and relax with a nice drink...but what should you drink? This app helps you answer that burning question that we all have. You can choose a random drink or search for drinks made with a specific ingredient you may have! Please enjoy, but drink responsibly!

Please drink responsibly at:
